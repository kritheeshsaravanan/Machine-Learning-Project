MEG Datasets Project
Overview
This repository contains information and resources related to Magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets collected for analyzing brain dynamics associated with cognitive and neurological functions. MEG is a neuroimaging technique that measures magnetic fields generated by neuronal activity, providing insights into brain function.

Abstract
This project focuses on acquiring high-quality MEG datasets from publicly available sources. The datasets are intended for research on brain activity related to motor and cognitive imagery, visual imagination, and geometric shape processing. The data acquisition methods emphasize ethical standards, reproducibility, and standardized procedures.

Data Acquisition Details
MEG data were recorded using a 306-channel Elekta Neuromag system, including magnetometers and planar gradiometers.

Participants were screened for metallic objects before entering magnetically shielded rooms.

Head position and orientation were tracked using fiducial landmarks and head position indicator coils.

Ocular and cardiac activities were monitored using electro-oculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (EKG) electrodes.

Data were filtered online (bandwidths typically between 0.01â€“300 Hz) and sampled at 1 kHz.

Participants were seated comfortably approximately 80 cm from a projector screen during recordings.

Some datasets include additional metadata files in .tsv format for events, channels, and participant demographics, following BIDS standards.

One dataset includes simultaneous EEG recordings with detailed electrode layouts and stimulus response data.

Dataset Formats
Raw MEG data in FIF format.

Compressed NumPy arrays (.npz) for MEG signal time series.

Tab-separated values (.tsv) files for metadata and event annotations.

Metadata includes sensor types, participant demographics, and experimental conditions.
